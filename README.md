# 🛡️ ReelBlock

> **Take back your time.** ReelBlock completely blocks YouTube Shorts, Facebook Reels, and Instagram Reels — with a smart daily time limit system when you need a controlled allowance.

> *This extension was built with the help of [Claude AI](https://claude.ai) by Anthropic.*

## ✨ Features

## 🚀 How to Use

### Basic blocking (default)
When you install the extension, **all reels and shorts are blocked immediately** — no setup needed. Visiting any of these URLs will redirect you to the site's homepage:
- `youtube.com/shorts/...`
- `facebook.com/reel/...`
- `instagram.com/reels/...`

### Allowing reels with a time limit
1. Click the 🛡️ icon in your Chrome toolbar
2. Flip the **toggle** from OFF → ON
3. Reels are now accessible, and your daily timer starts counting
4. When your daily limit is up, reels are blocked automatically and the toggle locks

### Settings (gear icon in popup)
Open the settings page to configure:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Daily Time Limit** | How many minutes of reels you can watch per day (5 min – 3 hrs) |
| **Daily Reset Time** | When your timer resets each day (midnight, 6 AM, noon, 6 PM) |
| **Usage Alert Interval** | Get an in-page check-in popup every 5 / 10 / 15 / 30 minutes while watching |
| **Theme** | Choose from 8 themes — applies to both popup and settings page |
| **Reset Today's Data** | Manually reset your daily timer |

### Alert overlay
When you've been watching for the configured interval, a dark overlay appears on the reel page showing your time used and time left — with a **Continue** or **Go Home** button.

### When time runs out
- The toggle in the popup snaps back to OFF
- A message shows: *"⏱️ Daily limit reached — resets at [time]"*
- All reels are immediately blocked again
- The timer resets automatically at your chosen reset time

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- Built with **Manifest V3** (the current Chrome extension standard)
- Uses `declarativeNetRequest` for network-level URL blocking/redirecting
- Uses `webNavigation.onHistoryStateUpdated` to catch SPA navigations on Facebook and Instagram
- Timer logic: starts on toggle ON, saves elapsed time on toggle OFF — stored in `chrome.storage.local`
- All data is local — nothing is sent anywhere
